# Project Requirements
After completing the book's exercises, you must demonstrate proficiency of react concepts by implementing the system described below.  Note: you can do something else as long as the same requirements are met.

## Task: Develop a web site that allows you to publish "articles" consisting of HTML.  
* Authenticated users can read, create, edit, and delete articles
* Non-authenticated users can read articles
* If you want, you can implement auth using OAuth or instead implement local auth system (e.g. store user names and passwords in DB)
    * Minimum requirement: have a master dummy password to test against
* Articles should be stored in a zero-config database (e.g. SQLite)
    * If you want to play around with a DB that requires a config, it must be dockerized
* Front end should be done in Bootsrap (either native or React-bootstrap)
* Back-end should be done in Express
* Routing via react-router

## Front-end views
1. Home page with a list of articles
2. Details page with a single article
3. Login page
4. Search page / feature 
5. Edit page
